(ISSUE #14)

To see the correct behavior for new talk proposals, go to the http://atlrug3.herokuapp.com/ web site and click on the
"Give a talk?" button item. Fill in the 5 fields and push the Submit button.

I have not seen the approval behavior so please see the skalnik's cucumber specs for hints.

Now go the http://atlrug4.herokuapp.com/ web site and click on the "Give a talk?" button item and you just get a placeholder text.

The Old code is in Mike's account: https://github.com/skalnik/atlrug3 repo.
I forked it too and have been sending pull requests back.

The New code is now in https://github.com/atlrug/atlrug4 repo.

UPDATE (5/6/2013):

Realized that the Twitter Bootstrap code maybe be involved too and I did
not port that part. I created a separate Github issue (#18) for that work.

These are the files with "bootstrap" in the filename:
 * app/assets/javascripts/bootstrap.js
 * app/assets/stylesheets/bootstrap_and_overrides.css.less
 * app/assets/javascripts/application.js (1 new line/BOOTSTRAP)
 * config/locales/en.bootstrap.yml (when you install Twitter bootstrap
 *  app/assets/stylesheets/application.css (comment with 2 require_*'s)
